# Project Title: RIO-125: Classification Model - Building a Drug Side Effect Classifier

### Company: TCS iON

### Industry Mentor: Debashis Roy

### Institute: ICT Academy of Kerala

### Duration: September 6, 2023, to December 5, 2023

### Total Effort: 125 hours

### Project Environment: Data Science

### Tools Used: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, Python, GitHub

### Project Summary:
### This internship project aimed to develop a Classification Model that can effectively predict the side effects of drugs based on demographic information and drug data. Side effects of medications can significantly impact patients' well-being, and our objective was to create a model that could help healthcare professionals make informed decisions when prescribing drugs.

### Key Project Activities:

Pre-assessment and Orientation: The project started with a foundation-laying pre-assessment test and orientation, understanding project reference materials.

Knowledge Acquisition: The intern actively engaged in webinars and recorded lectures to gain a strong understanding of the required concepts and tools.

Data Collection and Preparation: A dataset, combining WebMD data from Kaggle with synthesized data, was meticulously curated, including drug information and demographic factors.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): An in-depth EDA was performed to understand the dataset's structure, distribution, and patterns, identifying data trends and anomalies.

Data Preprocessing: Basic preprocessing involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to ensure data quality and consistency.

Data Splitting: The dataset was divided into training and testing sets to assess the model's performance on unseen data.

Model Selection and Training: Various machine learning models were implemented, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Naive Bayes. The models were trained using the scikit-learn library.

Model Evaluation: A comparative evaluation was conducted, and XGBoost emerged as the top-performing model with an accuracy of 0.98. Cross-validation was performed to ensure model robustness.

Challenges and Class Imbalance: Class imbalance in the dataset posed a challenge, which was addressed through oversampling, undersampling, and the use of different evaluation metrics.

Assumptions, Exceptions, and Model Fine-Tuning: Assumptions were made regarding the data, and model hyperparameter tuning was executed to enhance performance.

Ethical Considerations and Privacy: Ethical considerations and privacy concerns in healthcare data were discussed to ensure responsible model deployment.

Future Enhancements: Several enhancement opportunities were identified, including feature engineering, model fine-tuning, real-time data integration, and ethical considerations.

Research Questions and Responses: Research questions related to model performance, challenges, enhancements, ethical concerns, and the model's impact were addressed.

### Conclusion:

#### This project successfully built a drug side effect classification model, with XGBoost showing the highest accuracy. It has the potential to make a positive impact in the healthcare industry by assisting healthcare professionals in making informed decisions about drug prescriptions.

### Enhancement Scope:

Opportunities for enhancing the model, addressing ethical concerns, and achieving practical deployment were identified for future work.
